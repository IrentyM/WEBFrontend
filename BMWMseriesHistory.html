            <h2 class="quo">7 milestones from 50 years of BMW M history</h2>
            <p class="main-info">50 years old and fit as a fiddle: Expect nothing else from BMW M,
            the sporty sub-brand of BMW. We celebrate this occasion by presenting seven legendary
            models from half a century of BMW M history.</p>
        </section>
        <div>
            <p class="history">
                In the 50 years of its history, BMW M has put many models on the road that
                have gone on to become classics, legends, even icons. And all this on top
                of the tremendous sales successes that the BMW M models have celebrated
                and continue to celebrate. It seems an almost impossible task to select a 
                mere seven of them for the landmark anniversary, because the BMW M3 CSL, BMW 
                M Roadster and many others thoroughly deserve a place on this list too. But 
                back to the chosen 7: Models that were ahead of their time – and perhaps 
                still are today – have made it onto the ultimate bucket list for BMW M fans. 
                BMW M fans are not the only ones who can look forward to this great 
                transformation in automotive engineering. The BMW Concept XM is living proof 
                of this. So, now the curtain rises on 7 milestones from half a century of BMW 
                M history.

                <h4>BMW 3.0 CSL (E9) 1971</h4> 
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-02-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW 3.0 CSL (E9) 1971">               
                <p>The first BMW M car, developed with Alpina, featured a 3.2L inline-six producing 206 hp in its final 1973 form. Weighing just 1,270 kg, the lightweight “Coupé Sport Leichtbau” earned the nickname “Batmobile” with its striking design and impressive performance. Only 167 units were made.</p>
                <h4>BMW M1 (E26) 1978</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-03-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW M1 (E26) 1978">
                <p>Designed by Giorgio Giugiaro, the BMW M1 combined a 3.5L four-valve engine and racetrack-ready handling. With just 450 units produced from 1978-1981, its rarity and art connection (thanks to Andy Warhol) make it a true icon.</p>
                <h4>BMW M3 (E30) 1986</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-04-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW M3 (E30) 1986">
                <p>A favorite among BMW enthusiasts, the M3 (E30) featured a 195 hp engine and a sporty, widened body. Originally designed for racing, it quickly became a hit with customers and dominated the touring car world, cementing its legendary status.</p>
                <h4>BMW M5 Touring (E61) 2007</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-05-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW M5 Touring (E61) 2007">
                <p>The only BMW model to feature a 10-cylinder engine, the M5 Touring delivered 507 hp with racing-inspired performance. Produced in limited numbers, it's now a sought-after collector's item.</p>
                <h4>BMW X6 M (E71) 2009</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-06-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW X6 M (E71) 2009">
                <p>A pioneer of the Sports Activity Coupe, the X6 M packed a bi-turbo V8 with 555 hp and all-wheel drive. This SUV-sports car crossover proved naysayers wrong, becoming a successful blend of performance and utility.</p>
                <h4>BMW M2 CS (F87) 2019</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-07-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW M2 CS (F87) 2019">
                <p>The M2 CS epitomizes “Joy of driving” with a 450 hp bi-turbo inline-six and lightweight construction, delivering cornering precision and thrilling performance. Built for both road and track, it’s a driver’s dream.</p>
                <h4>BMW i4 M50 (G26) 2021</h4>
                <img class="imagecar" src="https://www.bmw.com/content/dam/bmw/marketBMWCOM/bmw_com/categories/performance/milestones/ms-08-media-hd.jpg?imwidth=1440" alt="BMW i4 M50 (G26) 2021">
                <p>The i4 M50 is the first BMW M car powered by an electric motor, producing 544 hp and 795 Nm of torque. Its dynamic performance, sports suspension, and electrified future mark a new era for BMW M.</p>
